          <h3>Why Female Health Education Matters</h3>
          <p>
            There is a major lack of education surrounding female anatomy, especially
            when it comes to menstrual health. Many people do not know that their periods
            are irregular, or that painful symptoms are not always normal. While technology
            continues to advance, healthcare advocacy for women is still a serious issue.
            People deserve to understand their bodies and have more options than just
            being prescribed birth control.

          <p>
            These gaps exist because advocacy in women’s health has limits. Conditions
            like PCOS and endometriosis often get overlooked or dismissed. When women
            learn what symptoms mean, what questions to ask, and how to track their
            experiences, it becomes easier to advocate for themselves. We believe education is one
            of the strongest tools women can have.
